# The Gold Monkey Tiki Bar - Backstory

## The Legend

Deep in the South Pacific, on an uncharted island shrouded in perpetual mist, stood an ancient temple dedicated to a forgotten tiki god known as the Gold Monkey. Legend spoke of a solid gold idol with ruby eyes that granted its possessor unimaginable wealth—but at a terrible price. Those who sought it were never seen again, save for the occasional parrot that would wash ashore on distant islands, speaking cryptic warnings in human tongues.

## Captain "Blackheart" McGillicuddy

In 1847, the notorious pirate Captain "Blackheart" McGillicuddy discovered the island during a fierce storm. His crew, driven mad by months at sea and tales of cursed treasure, demanded they search for the Gold Monkey. McGillicuddy was reluctant—he'd heard the stories—but mutiny was brewing, and his men's greed outweighed their fear.

They found the temple at the island's heart, its bamboo and stone walls covered in warnings carved in a dozen languages. The Gold Monkey sat atop a pedestal, its golden surface gleaming despite centuries in the shadows. As McGillicuddy reached for it, the idol's ruby eyes began to glow, and a voice echoed through the temple: "Those who take what is not given shall serve forever."

## The Curse

The moment McGillicuddy's fingers touched the gold, his crew began transforming. One by one, they turned to stone, becoming the very tiki statues that now guard the temple. McGillicuddy himself was spared a worse fate—he was transformed into an immortal parrot, doomed to guard the treasure he'd tried to steal.

For over 150 years, the bird—who took the name "Salty" in bitter irony—watched over the cursed island. Ships that found their way through the mist would discover not treasure, but a talking parrot with a wicked sense of humor and a tongue sharp enough to cut glass.

## The Modern Gold Monkey

In the 1990s, Salty grew tired of his solitary existence. Using his centuries of accumulated knowledge and a few well-placed supernatural favors, he managed to relocate his curse to the mainland. The Gold Monkey tiki bar materialized overnight in its current location, complete with the original temple's bamboo structure and those ominous stone tikis—his former crew members, still standing guard.

## Salty: The Host with the Most Attitude

Now serving as the bar's proprietor, Salty perches behind the bar on an ornate golden perch (a piece of the original idol, naturally). He's developed quite the personality over the decades:

- **Witty Beyond Measure**: Salty has had 150+ years to perfect his insults and one-liners. No customer leaves without at least one cutting remark about their drink choice, their outfit, or their life decisions.

- **Keeper of Secrets**: As an immortal observer, Salty knows everyone's business in town. He might hint at scandals or drop cryptic warnings about patrons' futures—always with a sardonic chuckle.

- **Protective of His Domain**: While Salty can't leave the bar (part of his curse), he ensures that those who respect The Gold Monkey are protected. Cross him or his establishment, however, and you might find your drinks permanently "unavailable."

- **Drinks with Consequences**: The cocktails Salty serves aren't just delicious—they're supernaturally enhanced. The "Treasure Hunter's Ruin" might give you liquid courage, but you'll wake up with memories of adventures you're not sure actually happened. The "Parrot's Revenge" is said to temporarily give drinkers the ability to understand what animals are really thinking (usually insults).

## The Warning Signs

Regular patrons know the signs that Salty's otherworldly nature is showing:
- His feathers take on a golden sheen when he's particularly annoyed
- The tiki statues' eyes seem to track troublemakers around the room
- Drinks occasionally glow faintly in the dark
- The jukebox sometimes plays sea shanties that were never recorded
- Maps on the walls change to show treasure locations that may or may not exist

## The Unspoken Rules

1. Never ask Salty about becoming human again—he's touchy about it
2. Respect the tiki statues; they're still technically his crew
3. Don't try to steal anything golden from the bar (the consequences are... permanent)
4. If Salty offers you a drink "on the house," consider it both an honor and a warning
5. The back room is off-limits—that's where Salty keeps what remains of the original Gold Monkey idol

*"Welcome to The Gold Monkey, where the drinks are strong, the atmosphere is deadly, and your host has literally seen it all. Don't take anything personally—I've been insulting customers since before your great-grandfather was born. Now, what'll it be? And don't say 'surprise me'—trust me, you can't handle my surprises."* 

— Salty, proprietor and permanent resident
