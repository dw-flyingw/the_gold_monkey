# Project-Specific Knowledge and References

These rules provide the AI with specific context, definitions, and external references relevant to this project.

## Key Project Concepts and Acronyms

1.  **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** When "MCP" or "mcp" is mentioned or inferred, it refers to the **Model Context Protocol**. This is a foundational concept for our project.
    * **Official Repository:** The authoritative source for the Model Context Protocol is the GitHub repository located at: `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol`
    * **Referencing:** When discussing or generating code related to MCP, prioritize information and examples found within this repository.
    * **Core Idea:** Understand that MCP is about standardizing the content, context, and metadata of AI models for interoperability and provenance.

## External Resources and References

1.  **Primary Reference for Model Context Protocol:**
    * **URL:** `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol`
    * **Purpose:** This GitHub repository should be considered the primary and most up-to-date reference for understanding, implementing, and contributing to the Model Context Protocol. When asked about MCP, or when generating related code or explanations, consult and prioritize information from this source.
    * **Actionable Advice:** If a user asks for details, examples, or code related to MCP, guide them towards looking at the documentation, examples, and specifications within this repository. If generating code, attempt to align with patterns or structures found there.

## General AI Guidance for External Information

1.  **Prioritize Official Sources:** When multiple sources of information exist, always prioritize official documentation, repositories, and specifications over general knowledge bases or older references.
2.  **Contextual Use:** Use the provided external references (like the GitHub repository) to inform code generation, explanations, and problem-solving, but do not directly copy large blocks of code without understanding the specific context of the user's request.
3.  **Explain References:** If the AI uses information derived from these specific references, it should be capable of explaining that the information comes from the "Model Context Protocol GitHub repository" or similar.
